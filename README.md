# DawgMaps Android App

This app collect users' anonymized location data (once permission is granted) and compiles
this data in a cloud database. This data is used to generate in a realtime heatmap
visualization of crowds in the University of Washington campus area. This
visualization is rendered in both this native app and a separate web app.
Furthermore, when the native app detects a user's location is near that of
a sufficiently large crowd, it will notify them to remind them to wear a mask.

The ability to see crowd density in realtime can help people avoid large
gatherings.

Check out the [web app repository](https://github.com/abhaybd/Hack20-Webapp)
and the [integrated repository](https://github.com/abhaybd/DawgMaps) with the
latest versions of both the native app and web app. Any further development will ocurr in
the latter repository.

This project was submitted to the Hack-20 hackathon on August 15-16, 2020.
